# AQM
### This repository contains the material created for the Advanced Quantum Mechanics course held at the University of Trieste by prof. Bassi and dott. Grossi.
### The project concerns the emergence of a Parity-Dependent Quantum Phase Transition in the Quantum Ising Chain. 
### There are notes containing the analytical calculation and notebook where the simulations were run.
### In particular "qpt_project.ipynb" is the main notebook, while "thermal_ibm_noise.ipynb" contains the noisy simulation with thermal relaxation and ibm custom noise.
